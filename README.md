# Song Filter
Program to help speed up screening of music by checking for blacklisted words
within a song. Lyrics are obtained from online lyrics sites like Genius.

###Please note:
This program does **NOT** guarantee that a song is clean, it only finds songs that
go against FCC guidelines.

## Installation
Installing is fairly straight forward. All that is required is python 3 and
beautiful soup 4.

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage
When given the name of a .songs file, the program will do the rest. Run main.py
and give it the name of the file without .songs at end. See sample.songs for an 
example on how to add artists and songs.

## TODO
1. Finish main driver
2. Pull lyrics from Genius 
3. Make function to read a .songs file
4. Have informative output 
5. Add ability to cross check other sites
